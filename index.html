  <h4>Education is all about gathering knowledge and training the mind to think and apply reasoning to solve problems. It is the foundation on which any person, society, or country progresses. While our country has grown and developed over time, we may take the value of education for granted.

 The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates.
     A teacher is a compass that activates the magnets of curiosity, knowledge, and wisdom in the pupils.
